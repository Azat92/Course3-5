Settings.bundle demonstration

Demo project that shows main `Settings.bundle` features: using Xcode' `plist` editor and from the code.
Also, here you can find another useful way to edit `Settings.bundle` - using `PlistBuddy` - a powerful tool for
`plist` read and modification. In the project there is a script, that runs before deploying app to the device
and sets the bundle version to the appropriate key in the `Settings.bundle`
